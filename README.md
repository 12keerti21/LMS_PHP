# LMS_PHP
This project is a **Learning Management System (LMS)** built with **PHP**, **Bootstrap**, and **MySQL**. It allows students to **register, log in, and track course progress in real-time**, while tutors can only sign in after being authorized by an admin. The system includes secure validation and authentication for both students and tutors.
